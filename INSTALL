Basic Installation
==================

The build system for compiling the hdf5-sharp library is `nant'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `nant' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `nant run-tests' to run some unit-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `nant install' to install the library and data files.


Options
=======

Currently, the nant script supports two user-configurable options. The first
is `prefix' to specify a different install location. By default, the library
installs in `/usr/local'. The second option is `build-configuration' which can
either be `Debug' (default) or `Release'.

For example, if you want to install the release-version of the library in
`/opt/hdf5-sharp', you would have to issue the following commands:

     nant -D:prefix=/opt/hdf5-sharp -D:build-configuration=Release
     nant run-tests -D:prefix=/opt/hdf5-sharp -D:build-configuration=Release
     nant install -D:prefix=/opt/hdf5-sharp -D:build-configuration=Release


Build Targets
=============

The following build targets are currently supported:

* all (default): compiles everything.
* run-tests: runs the unit tests.
* install: copies the binary files to the configured location.
* clean: deletes all generated and compiled files.
