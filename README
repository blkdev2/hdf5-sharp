ABOUT
-----

The hdf5-sharp library allows access to files in the HDF5 format from programs
written for the .NET framework.

The hdf5-sharp library tries to provide an API for programming the HDF5
library that does not feel alien to users of the .NET standard libraries. It
seeks to follow the framework design guidelines for .NET libraries where
possible. This means in particular that the HDF5 function names are adapted to
a more .NET-friendly style.

The library features a mapping of the HDF5 type system to the .NET types. This
design goal trades feature completeness against ease of use. Since all
supported datatypes must be binary compatible to existing .NET types, very
special HDF5 files with arbitrary precision datatypes are not supported.


REQUIREMENTS
